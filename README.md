# PlaticaBot

PlaticaBot is a ChatGPT app for MacOS, iPhone and WatchOS.  I got this
app because I found it useful to have this one around, and since I
already have an OpenAI account, I did not want to rely on a third
party or buy a third party subscription to access my account.

To use on the watch, you will want to first start the Mac or iPhone
app, and set your key there, so that the watch can get it.

I had to re-import this project, because originally this was purely
for my own use, and I hardcoded the OpenAI key in my git history, so
if you find any issues, please post them here and I'll take a look, or
even better, send me tasty PRs.
